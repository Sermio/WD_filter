This is a Proof of Concept (POC) for an application designed to display a list of items retrieved mainly from .CSV files. 
The application provides users with the ability to filter the displayed items based on specific parameters, allowing for easy navigation and targeted data retrieval. Additionally, it supports the import and processing of data from .CSV files, enabling users to seamlessly integrate external datasets into the application for further analysis or filtering.

This version clarifies the sources of the items, emphasizes user interaction through filtering, and specifies the role of CSV file support.
